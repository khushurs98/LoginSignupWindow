## Key Features
- **Routing with `react-router-dom`**
  - Provides client-side routing with components like `Routes`, `Route`, and `Navigate`.

- **Dynamic Navigation**
  - Includes features like redirects (`Navigate`) for handling unauthenticated access or non-existent routes.

- **Error Handling**
  - Displays appropriate fallback UI for undefined or restricted routes.

---

## Dependencies
### Main Libraries:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **react-router-dom**: A routing library for React that provides declarative navigation and dynamic routing capabilities.

### Development Tools:
- **Webpack**: Module bundler.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler.

---

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues:
1. **`Switch` not found error**
   - **Cause**: `Switch` has been replaced with `Routes` in `react-router-dom v6`.
   - **Fix**: Replace `<Switch>` with `<Routes>`.

2. **`Redirect` not found error**
   - **Cause**: `Redirect` has been replaced with `Navigate` in `react-router-dom v6`.
   - **Fix**: Replace `<Redirect to="/path" />` with `<Navigate to="/path" />`.

3. **Package issues**
   - Ensure you're using the correct version of `react-router-dom`:
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom@^6
     ```

---

## Migration Notes
If you're migrating from `react-router-dom v5` to `v6`, keep the following in mind:
- Replace `Switch` with `Routes`.
- Replace `Redirect` with `Navigate`.
- Adjust props in `<Route>` for `element` instead of `component`:
  ```jsx
  // v5
  <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />

  // v6
  <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
  ```
